Collections
- contain a collection of related items
- flexible

3 basic collections
- List
- Sets
- Maps

Lists
- ordered
- can contain duplicates
- a list isn't a class, it's an interface
- ArrayList is a class that implements the List interface
- [] donates an empty list

Sets
- unordered
- cannot contain duplicates
- Hashset is a class that implements the Set interface - no order
- Treeset is a class that implements the Set interface - order (natural order depending on data type)

Maps
- Key/Value pairs
- unordered
- cannot have duplicate keys but duplicate values is okay
- HashMap is a class that implements the Map interface
- LinkedHashMap allows for ordering
- TreeMap allows for natural ordering depending on the data type
